Getting started with `R` in the Dworkin lab
===========================================

I have extensive notes and introduction as part of the [Bio720 class](https://github.com/DworkinLab/Bio720/blob/master/Introduction_to_R.md) and I suggest starting there.

If you are just starting out.. suggested course of action...
intro book. CSE845 notes and screencasts...ZOL851.... Bolker, R Book, R in a nutshell, Hadley's book.

## Insane number of useful resources....

## Gentle introductory resources
