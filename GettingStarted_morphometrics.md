Getting started with geometric morphometrics analysis in the Dworkin lab
========================================================================

# This is just a stub to remind me to get this written

**To be completed**

## Introductory readings
[Geometric Morphometrics for Biologists](http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123869036) - requires library proxy for access (I do not think we have it at McMaster). We have a PDF of it in the lab dropbox space (so contact me for access to that space).

[Morphometrics with R](http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-0-387-77789-4) - this is mostly useful once you are comfortable with the basics. There is no single  `R` library but a collection of functions. Much of which is also available in `geomorph` or `shapes` in `R` (see below).

## Software
[geomorph/R](http://www.geomorph.net/). Geomorph has really really gone a great way to develop a very general purpose set of analysis tools for morphometrics. Their blog has lots of useful tutorials and tips and tricks. Indeed, much of what we had originally written in `R` is now somewhat redundant. Since `geomorph` has a larger user base than our lab scripts, it is more likely that bugs in the code are to be found. Thus I recommend getting used to it.

[Morpho/R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Morpho/index.html). Another `R` library for morphometrics. Some of the basiic tools overlap with `geomorph`, but there are many advanced plotting tools that differ. Also check out [the blog](http://zarquon42b.github.io/) associated with both `Morpho` and the authors other packages (i.e. `Rvcg`). The authors [github page also may be useful](https://github.com/zarquon42b).

[StonyBrook morphometrics](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/) -  This includes access to [TPS software](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/) for morphometrics analysis, and links to many other useful resources.
