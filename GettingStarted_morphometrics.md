Getting started with geometric morphometrics analysis in the Dworkin lab
========================================================================

# This is just a stub to remind me to get this written

## Introductory readings
[Geometric Morphometrics for Biologists](http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123869036) - requires MSU library proxy for access.

[Morphometrics with R](http://ezproxy.msu.edu:2047/login?url=http://link.springer.com/openurl?genre=book&isbn=978-0-387-77789-4) - this is mostly useful once you are comfortable with the basics. There is no single  `R` library but a collection of functions. Much of which is also available in `geomorph` or `shapes` in `R` (see below).

## Software
[MorphoJ](http://www.flywings.org.uk/MorphoJ_page.htm)

[geomorph/R](http://www.geomorph.net/)

[shapes/R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shapes/index.html)

[StonyBrook morphometrics](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/) -  This includes access to [TPS software](http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/morph/) for morphometrics analysis, and links to many other useful resources.
