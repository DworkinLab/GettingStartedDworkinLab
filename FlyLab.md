FLY ROOM PROTOCOL
=================


WHEN FIRST JOINING THE LAB:
 
These readings are essential!!!!  Please read. They are also worth re-reading several months after you have joined the lab, as many things which initially made little sense, will make a lot more.

###Drosophila basics:
Please read the excellent [How to design a genetic mating scheme: a basic training package for Drosophila genetics](http://figshare.com/articles/How_to_design_a_genetic_mating_scheme_a_basic_training_package_for_Drosophila_genetics/106631). The article describing the overview of this package can be read [here](http://www.g3journal.org/content/3/2/353.full.pdf+html)


Fly Pushing (Greenspan):  Chapters 1, 4-5

Drosophila: A Practical Approach (Roberts, ed.): Chapter 1 (also chapter 9 for behavioural work).

Drosophila Guide (Demerec):   p. 3-16, *30-44 *optional/use as reference

Drosophila Protocols:  chapter 35

Developmental Biology: A guide for experimental study (Tyler). chapter 8 (in particular, pages 94-101)

###Basic laboratory skills (essential):
At the Bench: Chapters 1, 3-9.  **(Everyone should read these chapters)**.

-If you  are doing DNA/RNA work then also read Chapters 12,14,15. 
                        
-If you are doing  microscopy read chapter 16 of at the Bench. (Also read Chapter 3 of "Developmental Biology: A Guide for Experimental Study").

If you are doing any molecular cloning read chapter 11.
                        
                        
Further reading will be required for specific projects.

##Working in the fly lab: 
###IN A.M., First person in:
   Get fly food out of fridge. ~1 tray of bottles and 1 of vials (tegosept and non-tegosept).
   Get brushes, funnels, transfer pads, paper towel, eppendorf tubes and yeast from freezer
 
###IN P.M., Last person out:
   Put fly food in fridge, properly bagged
   Put brushes, funnels, transfer pads, paper towel, eppendorf tubes and yeast in freezer
   Make sure gas is off. (clear pressure from system)
   Turn off lights
  
###USING MICROSCOPES:
   NO MASCARA
   Do not turn light source above 70 as it will increase chances of burning out a bulb
   If you will be working with multiple lines, clean plate and brush between lines
   When finished, spray CO2 plate, brush, and surrounding area with ethanol and wipe, Cover
   *Check with others and turn off gas if not in use (clear pressure from system)
 
###AT ALL TIMES:
   Keep vials and bottles covered
 

Maintain awareness of your neighbors and collaborators, and any flies they may be contributing to
the local environment. Diligently hunt down any easily caught flies with a paper towel.
 
####Know your flies and what they should look like. 
Check ~every 3 generations for appropriate eye color, wing shape, balancer, etc. to make sure there is no contamination from other fly lines or mites. There is no shame in something happening, there is much shame in not reporting it!
 
####Keep an eye on the fly food levels.
When vials are down to about half a tray, get another from the fridge to warm up. If food in fridge is running low, do a quick inventory of how much we have and how much you/others will be using and go and get an appropriate amount from the Miller Lab.
**Remember to return keys to drawer when done**
 
####Neatly stack empty fly food trays. 
If a large pile begins to accumulate, take them when going to get food and put in Miller Lab freezer for a minimum of 48 hours. Move to fly food room (343) the next time you are over there.
   Keep the room tidy!

##WORKING WITH FLIES
   1) When working with KEY strains like ORE and SAM (and derivatives) only work with one strain at a time **at the bench**. That is do all of your work with the SAM strain (i.e. virgin collections, crosses, adding water, etc...), and then clean off your CO2 plate, brush, etc... just as if you were finishing all of your fly work. Put these stocks away, and then, get the other stocks (i.e. ORE), and proceed with the work for them.  You should not have the ORE and SAM strains in physical proximity while you are working, so that there is no chance of accidentally grabbing the wrong strain for use.
 
   2) Pre-label vials, and CHECK and then RE-CHECK LABELS as you are working. This is the most common cause of contamination. During routine transfers of flies to fresh vials, two strains are placed in the wrong position in the tray, and then when they are being used for crosses the labels are not checked carefully enough and the wrong flies are used. You may wish to re-organize your stocks so that it will be less likely for you to make a mix up (i.e. do not keep two strains that are morphologically indistinguishable next to one another), or at the very least easier to diagnose when a mix-up or contamination has occurred.
 
   3) **NEVER HAVE MULTIPLE GENOTYPES ON THE CO2 PLATE AT THE SAME TIME!!!!**
Despite it's apparent efficiency, never have a mix of strains on the plate at the same time. In addition it is best to keep the vials/bottles for the vials on your place in the same spot as you work, and then move them out of reach as you start to work with the next set of strains.
 
   4) When looking at progeny of crosses or from your stocks that appear "unexpected" in some way (i.e. wrong phenotype, white eyes when they should be red or vise-versa.) please come speak to me or at the very least show it to other people in the lab to help identify if it is new and interesting for a cool reason or simply a result of contamination.
 
   5) Report any possible sources of contamination to me immediately. I will not be upset if we catch it early, I will likely be much less pleased if it is left un-checked, and spreads.
 
   6) If a fly falls off of the CO2 plate while you are workin, DO NOT USE IT. Treat it as a source of contamination. Similarly if there is a fly on the plate that looks wrong (i.e. it is off on one corner of the
plate), assume that it is a source of contamination and remove it immediately. It is also important to check the CO2 plate for any stray flies that may have landed on the plate, or did not fall into the morgue BEFORE putting a new set of flies on the plate.
 
   7) Organize yourself well before setting up mass crosses. When you are performing a lot of crosses all at once (say more than 10), the possibility of contamination can increase very quickly. It is very important that you organize everything very well before you start the fly work (pre-labeling vials, like with a molecular experiment). Again, it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to check and re-check labels, and the flies you are working with because it is very easy to get strains mixed up when you are working with a lot of them. Develop some protocols to double-check your work.
 
   8) If you think you may have accidentally mixed up lines in a cross, or mis-labeled a strain, write a note on the vial/bottle (not just in your lab notebook), and report it to me and we will figure out a way of checking it. If it is a cross that can be redone easily, throw the questionable one out, and redo it.
 
   9) Double check with Ian prior to completely throwing out any main fly stocks
FLY MAINTENANCE:
   At Room Temp, vials should be transferred no later than 18 days after setting up. Parents can be removed once larvae are present (~3-5 days). Can wait longer if desired, no later than ~9 days.
   At 24 degrees, vials should be transferred no later than 16 days after setting up. Parents can be removed once larvae are present (~3-5 days). Can wait longer if desired, no later than ~8 days.
   At 18 degrees, vials should be transferred no later than 21 days after setting up. Parents can be removed once larvae are present (~5 days). Can wait longer if desired, no later than ~10 days.
 
   When maintaining stocks, keep at least one copy as back up. Between the copies of a line, transfers should be staggered; transfer only if larvae are present in the copy. Ideally, both copies should be checked at once- when transferring flies from one copy, dump parents from the other
  
   When transferring, check and add yeast, water or paper towel as needed.
 
   Label vials or tray with the date transferred to help yourself remember when they were last looked at/when they need to be transferred next.
  
TIPS & TRICKS:
   For fly pushing,
Use thin brushes, big brushes are more likely to trap flies
Make sure all flies are cleared from plate between different genotypes
Check brush before adding any flies to vials or bottles

 
   For weak stocks,
Note stock and check more frequently, keeping up on water or yeast can do wonders!
Score food before adding flies
If possible, keep at 24 degrees
