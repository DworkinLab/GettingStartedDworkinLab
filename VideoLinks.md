# Video links of use to the lab

Not surprisingly general websites like youtube, and more specialized ones like [JoVE](https://www.jove.com/) have useful videos. We have access to JoVE via McMaster library.

Here are some links to things as I find them.

Note that does not mean we do things *exactly* like this in our lab, but it will give you a useful first impression.
