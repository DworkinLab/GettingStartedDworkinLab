#How to keep a happy flyroom (LSB 503).

The idea of the [flyroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zloG5hSEYNk) as the intellectual and experimental center of genetic analysis is a long one. It is so cool, and so many great ideas and experiments came out of the *original flyroom* that not only did it result in numerous scientific breakthroughs in genetics, but they even made a [movie about the flyroom itself](http://www.theflyroom.com/)!

## A clean and organized flyroom is a happy flyroom

Not only do we want the flyroom to be a place for wonderful conversations and stimulating science (and a little bit of biting satire), we also want it to be a happy and healthy place to work for humans and Drosophila alike. That means some basic, but regular hygiene to minimize the chances of contamination (from other fly strains), infestation (from mites) or infection (from molds, bacteria and viruses). Since three labs are sharing the flyroom (all the better to stimulate great collaborations among all of you), we all need to share in helping keeping the lab clean.

So with that in mind, here are some protocols we have instituted (as of August 5^th 2015) to keep the room happy.

## What to do with old fly vials and bottles

## disinfecting horizontal surfaces (benches) and general clean up.
Mondays after the fly meeting (~ i.e. meet in the fly lab at approximately 12:30 each monday).

## Overnight freezing of brushes and foam pads (sometimes called bunging pads) for transferring flies.

## The fly transfer bench.
