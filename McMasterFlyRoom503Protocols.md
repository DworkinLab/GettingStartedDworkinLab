# How to keep a happy, safe and secure flyroom (LSB 503).

The idea of the [flyroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zloG5hSEYNk) as the intellectual and experimental center of genetic analysis is a long one. It is so cool, and so many great ideas and experiments came out of the *original flyroom* that not only did it result in numerous scientific breakthroughs in genetics, but they even made a [movie about the flyroom itself](http://www.theflyroom.com/)!

**Please note: This document can change as we further establish joint protocols for use of the fly room, as new rules from both CFIA and ECCC are implemented, so check it each semester.**

**Please note, that special standard operating procedures are in place for pest species of *Drosophila*. Please see bottom section of this document if you are working with species other than *Drosophila melanogaster*. If you are you will receive special training and instructions on working with and disposing of known pest species.

## A clean and organized flyroom is a happy flyroom

Not only do we want the flyroom to be a place for wonderful conversations and stimulating science (and a little bit of biting satire), we also want it to be a happy and healthy place to work for humans and *Drosophila* alike. That means basic, but regular hygiene to minimize the chances of contamination (from other fly strains), infestation (from mites) or infection (from molds, bacteria and viruses).
**Indeed, even escaped flies can transmit bacteria if they land on your (clean) plate or paint brush!!!!**. Since two labs are sharing the flyroom (all the better to stimulate great collaborations among all of you), we all need to share in helping keeping the lab clean.

So with that in mind, here are some protocols we have instituted (as of August 5<sup>th</sup> 2015) to keep the denizens of the room happy.

## What to do with old fly vials and bottles

- Vials and bottles can be discarded in regular plastic garbage bags.
- When these garbage bags are full, tie them off, and place in the freezer for at least 36 hours. This will kill all flies. These bags are then to be discarded (each lab is currently responsible for their own) in the dumpsters behind LSB.
- Keep in mind that old vials/bottles can be a breeding ground for bacteria, mites, etc.. which can then establish and infest our stocks and our room. Clearing a mite infestation **IS NOT** fun.

## Disinfecting horizontal surfaces (benches) and general clean up.
- After each use of a fly station (CO<sub>2</sub> plate), you should always disinfect the plate, base of microscope and brushes with 70% ethanol. Spray it, let it sit for a minute before wiping it down. 
- Each mondays after the fly lab meeting (~ i.e. everyone meet in 503LSB at approximately 12:30 each monday) members of all three labs (Campos, Dworkin & Jacobs) will meet to give the room a quick cleaning (~30 minutes).
- In particular this will involve disinfecting all horizontal surfaces (such as the benches). Alternate each week with either 70% ethanol, or 5% bleach. 
- It is probably helpful to even do this under trays on shelves (as deadflies seem to accumulate in such places).
- A monthly wipedown of the insides of the two incubators is also necessary.

## Overnight freezing of brushes and foam pads (sometimes called bunging pads) for transferring flies.
- As part of the general preventitive maintainence (to avoid mite infestation), paint brushes and foam pads used for transferring should be placed in the freezer overnight. So last person out should do a double check for any stray brushes or pads.
- Keep in mind the freezer will only kill (we hope) mites. It will not kill any molds, viruses or bacteria. This is why it is also important to spray the brushes (and plates) with lots of 70% after use (to avoid any cross contamination).

## The fly transfer bench.
The "back bench" (the one with no scopes) will now be the general fly transfer station. After use, please disinfect with either 5% bleach or 70% ethanol, and place foam pads in the freezer.
