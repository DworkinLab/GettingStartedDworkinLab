# How to keep a happy, safe and secure flyroom (LSB 503).

The idea of the [flyroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zloG5hSEYNk) as the intellectual and experimental center of genetic analysis is a long one. It is so cool, and so many great ideas and experiments came out of the *original flyroom* that not only did it result in numerous scientific breakthroughs in genetics, but they even made a [movie about the flyroom itself](http://www.theflyroom.com/)!

**Please note: This document can change as we further establish joint protocols for use of the fly room, as new rules from both CFIA and ECCC are implemented, so check it each semester.**

**Please note** special standard operating procedures are in place for pest species of *Drosophila*. Please see bottom section of this document if you are working with species **other** than *Drosophila melanogaster*. If you are working with a pest as designated by CFIA (PPC-1) you will receive special training and instructions on working with and disposing of these species.

## A clean and organized flyroom is a happy flyroom

Not only do we want the flyroom to be a place for wonderful conversations and stimulating science (and a little bit of biting satire), we also want it to be a happy and healthy place to work for humans and *Drosophila* alike. That means basic, but regular hygiene to minimize the chances of contamination (from other fly strains), infestation (from mites) or infection (from molds, bacteria and viruses).
**Indeed, even escaped flies can transmit bacteria if they land on your (clean) plate or paint brush!!!!**. Since two labs are sharing the flyroom (all the better to stimulate great collaborations among all of you), we all need to share in helping keeping the lab clean.

So with that in mind, here are some protocols we have instituted (as of August 5<sup>th</sup> 2015) to keep the denizens of the room happy.


## Your person and your stuff
- Personal bags, knapsacks etc should not be kept in LSB 503
- As with any lab, no food or drink is allowed into the lab
- If you have long hair, please have it tied back when working in LSB 503

## What to do with old fly vials and bottles

- Vials and bottles can be discarded in plastic garbage bags.
- When these garbage bags are full, tie them off, and place in the freezer for 24 hours. This will kill all flies. These bags are then to be discarded (each lab is currently responsible for their own) in the dumpsters behind LSB.
- Keep in mind that old vials/bottles can be a breeding ground for bacteria, mites, etc.. which can then establish and infest our stocks and our room. Clearing a mite infestation **IS NOT** fun.

## No living plant material in LSB 503
- In case of anyone working with a potential plant pest species (unlikely but possible), we do not allow any live plant material in LSB 503.

## Disinfecting horizontal surfaces (benches) and general clean up.

- Before and after each use of a fly station (CO<sub>2</sub> plate), you should always disinfect the plate, base of microscope and brushes with 70% ethanol. Spray it, let it sit for a minute before wiping it down. 
- Each monday after the fly lab meeting (~ i.e. everyone meet in 503LSB at approximately 12:30 each monday) members of all labs (Dworkin & Jacobs) will meet to give the room a quick cleaning (~30 minutes).
- In particular this will involve disinfecting all horizontal surfaces (such as the benches). Alternate each week with either 70% ethanol, or 5% bleach. 
- It is probably helpful to even do this under trays on shelves.
- A monthly wipedown of the insides of the two incubators is also necessary.

## Overnight freezing of brushes and foam pads (sometimes called bunging pads) for transferring flies.
- As part of the general preventitive maintainence (to avoid mite infestation), paint brushes and foam pads used for transferring should be placed in the freezer overnight. So last person out should do a double check for any stray brushes or pads.
- Keep in mind the freezer will only kill (we hope) mites. It will not kill any molds, viruses or bacteria. This is why it is also important to spray the brushes (and plates) with lots of 70% ethanol after use (to avoid any cross contamination).

## The fly transfer bench.
The "back bench" (the one with no scopes) will now be the general fly transfer station. After each use, please disinfect with either 5% bleach or 70% ethanol, and place foam pads in the freezer.

## When leaving the lab
- Do a check on your person for any live Drosophila.
- Wash your hands prior to leaving room 503.


## Working with potential pest species
- If you are working with any of the following species (*species go here*) then there are additional protocols to follow.
- There is a small, seperate waste receptacle for working with these species. Discard old carefully sealed vials in gthis receptacle. These vials should be frozen (for 24 hours), prior to being disposed of. 
- When working with a potential pest species, take additional care at the carbon dioxide anesthetizing station, to make sure all flies are immbolized prior to working with the flies.
- If you are doing live fly transfers from vial to vial, or bottle to bottle, these should be done inside the bugdorm insect cage that is on the shelf, to prevent any accidental escape.
- As always, do both a visual inspection and disinfect work area when you finish.
