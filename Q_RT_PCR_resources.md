# Resources for Quantitative real time PCR (for RNA expression) 
## Some links to introduce things

We have lots of resources in the lab (dropbox)

[Here is a broad overview](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/vme/taqmanservice/pdfs/Introduction_to_Real_Time_PCR.pdf)

[ThermoFisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/ca/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center.html) The real time PCR learning center.

[Also thermoFisher](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-webinars.html) real-time PCR webinars.

## Drosophila primers
 
 In addition to looking up published papers that have used primers (those have likely been checked and validated to some degree), for *Drosophila melanogaster* there is the FlyPrimerBank, the [link is here](https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/flyprimerbank-documentation). The paper for it is [here](http://www.g3journal.org/content/3/9/1607).

 ## overview
 
 ## Primer design
 Many tools available (IDT,etc). QuantPrime is well maintained [here](http://quantprime.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/)
 
 ## things to keep in mind for checking primers
 - titration curves and amplification curves to examine efficiency
 - melting curves to check for secondary products...
 
 ## Analysis.
