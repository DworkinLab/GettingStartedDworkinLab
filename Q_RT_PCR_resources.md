## Drosophila primers
 
 In addition to looking up published papers that have used primers (those have likely been checked and validated to some degree), for *Drosophila melanogaster* there is the FlyPrimerBank, the [link is here](https://fgr.hms.harvard.edu/flyprimerbank-documentation). The paper for it is [here](http://www.g3journal.org/content/3/9/1607).
 
 
 ## overview
 
 ## Primer design
 Many tools available (IDT,etc). QuantPrime is well maintained [here](http://quantprime.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/)
 
 ## things to keep in mind for checking primers
 - titration curves and amplification curves to examine efficiency
 - melting curves to check for secondary products...
 
 ## Analysis.
