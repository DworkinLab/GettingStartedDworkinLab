Getting started in the Dworkin lab
========================

Documents to get folks started in the Dworkin Lab.

This folder contains several files to help get new members started in the Dworkin Lab. Some are for fly work, others for work in the molecular lab. For Computational and Statistical training there will be seperate repositories.

The files are really to help with a fairly limited range of technical skills and work flows in the labs, and are in no way meant to represent how you do your science!
