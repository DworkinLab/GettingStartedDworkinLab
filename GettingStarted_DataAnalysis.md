Dworkin lab Guide to organizing your scripts and data files
===========================================================

## -This is a draft outline, not to be used yet.-

## Why be so precise about how we organize our data and analysis scripts?
- Make it easy and efficient for current use.
- Make it easy and efficient for future use.
- 
## Make your research reproducible from day one

##File formats
- Why we use flat text files
- Excel is ok for data entry, but not for long term storage
- Why we use .csv for "spreadhseets
- When to use relational databases

## Folder structures
- Why we have a recommended folder structure
- The recommended folder structure
- Example
- See blog postings that suggest why to use this.
 See [here](http://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/) for some ideas of how to organize your folders.

While [this](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424) article is written for computational biology projects, it holds in general.

## Scripting
- Philosophy for organizing scripts.
- Source scripts (for functions) and analysis scripts.
- Syntax style guide for [R](https://www.msu.edu/~idworkin/ZOL851_style_guide.html)
- Syntax style guide for python

## Some brief notes on *Sanity Checks* during analysis
- Philosophy: Assume there are mistakes in the data and analysis until you convince yourself otherwise.
- Sanity checks on the computational process (Unit testing)
- Sanity checks on data
- Sanity checks on the analysis
- Some important readings.

## Resources for programming and analysis in R
 There are many many resoucres out there that you can find all over the web. In addition on the lab folders (the shared dropbox folder) there are PDFs of several useful books. Here are just a few additional links

## Getting started using git and guthub

## Reproducible research
- markdown vs. LaTeX

-- [github flavoured markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)
-- [github flavoured markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- knitR & sweave
